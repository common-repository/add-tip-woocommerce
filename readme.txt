Allows customers to add amount to checkout fee(s).



== Description ==

This is a WooCommerce extension plugin that does simply one thing, which is to allow customer to add their own extra fee on Checkout Page, whether it be a donation or added custom fee.

Adding extra fee option shows up as a notice on checkout page, exactly the same as the coupon notice on WooCommerce. From there and then the customer can click on that notice and a drop down will occur prompting them to input extra amount.

They have the ability on checkout to input any extra amount. The Fee would be added alongside the regular order, meaning it will show up on the order summary on checkout page as a added extra fee, with a different heading so that customers and sellers can distinguish the different fees on purchase.

= PRO VERSION =

The <a href="http://www.trottyzone.com/product/add-tip-woocommerce/">Pro version</a> allows the customer to increment the amount via front-end using plus(+) or minus(-) sign, this increment amount can be added via back-end.

= Seller (admin) can input their own surcharge to be added to products:- =
* In the backend the admin(seller) can configure there surcharge (tax) to be added to amount on checkout.
* The title can be changed also.
* Surcharge calculation is the total amount on of all products added together multiplied by your custom percentage.
* Now this total amount can also be added with shipping fee also, and once added with, it will be grouped then multiplied by percentage. You can choose to enable the total amount to be added with shipping total.
* Only add surcharge for specific country. Will take address from delivery information.

= Seller can define their own custom charge:- =
* Customized the title and just simply input your own amount to be added.

* The field via backend can accept calculation value, example. (4 + 4) / (6*4) . In case you do not want to work out the amount yourself.
